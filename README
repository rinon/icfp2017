# Submission description

Our AI uses the UCT algorithm (which is a Monte Carlo Tree Search variant). Tree
search depth is limited during simulations to look at more moves on large maps.

# Build instructions

Our ./install script is empty, since you shouldn't need to rebuild our
submission. If you do need to, please use the following build command:

    cargo build --release --bin punter

The output binary will be found at target/release/punter. This build process
requires network access to download dependencies.
